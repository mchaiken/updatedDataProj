	<h2>The Analysis</h2>
</center>
<p><b>Average Number of Deaths with a Fire Arm:</b>
<br><b>Average Score for Gun control:</b>
<br><b>Statistics:</b> From this data I decided to find the number of states with bellow average scores for gun control, the number with above average rates of death by fire arm, and the number of states with both<br></p>
<p>30% seems like a small number, but this is out of all states, including those who may have had both high scores and low murder rates. The goal of this was to determine the validity of the brady campaign score. So the percent of states that recieved bellow average scores, and also have above average rates of death by fire arm might be more relevant.<br><br><b>15/34--->44.1%</b><br>This corolation is even clearer when plotted in a graph, kindly created by Jacob Olenik:<br><br><a href="http://homer.stuy.edu/~jacob.olenick/Gun%20Control1.html"><b>To View The Graph Click Here</b></a><br></p><center>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
</center>
<p>From this data we can see that about half of the states with bellow average scores from the Brady Campaign also have above average rates of murder with a fire arm.This isn't huge, but does suggest that there is at least some sort of coorilation between strength of gun control and muder rate with a fire arm. It should also be taken into account that in many places with stronger gun control, weapons are brough in from out of state illegally, and the death by fire arm rate in the US is over 40 times that of the UK. Either way, to suggest that these numbers should be dismissed or that there is no relation to the number of people who are killed by guns is untrue. </p>
